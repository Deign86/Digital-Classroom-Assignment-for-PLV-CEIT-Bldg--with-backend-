# Local Storage Configuration
# ---------------------------
# This project now runs entirely in the browser using localStorage.
# No environment variables are required for the default experience.
#
# You can optionally define custom environment variables here if you
# introduce new configuration flags in the future. Leave this file
# empty to use the built-in local demo data.

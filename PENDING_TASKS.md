# Pending Tasks

This file lists short-term tasks that are still in-progress on the
feature branch `feat/responsive-classroom-management`.

- [ ] Classroom reservation responsiveness — mobile/tablet layout and UX refinements (IN PROGRESS)
  - Status: Pending
  - Branch: feat/responsive-classroom-management
  - Notes: The shared `Tabs` implementation has been updated to auto-scroll
    the active tab for mobile tab lists. The classroom management component
    has been updated to provide a responsive layout, but additional QA and
    small UX refinements remain before marking this as complete.

Next steps:
- Verify mobile behavior across Admin and Faculty dashboards (auto-scroll active tab).
- Finish edge-case styling for classroom reservation cards and tables on small screens.
- Run end-to-end QA on booking flows and conflict detection on mobile.

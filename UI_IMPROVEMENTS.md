# UI Improvements - Digital Classroom Management System

## Overview
This document summarizes the UI improvements made to enhance the user experience and functionality of the Digital Classroom Management System.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. RequestApproval Component - Complete Redesign ✅
**File:** `components/RequestApproval.tsx`

**Problem:** Component was empty/corrupted and had poor CSS styling.

**Solution:** Completely recreated the component with modern, professional styling:

#### Features Added:
- **Tab-based Navigation:** Clean tabs for Pending, Approved, and Rejected requests
- **Improved Card Layout:** 
  - Better spacing and padding
  - Color-coded borders (orange for pending, green for approved, red for rejected)
  - Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
- **Status Badges:** Visual indicators for request status
- **Conflict Detection:** Real-time checking for scheduling conflicts
- **Feedback Dialog:** Professional confirmation dialog with animations
- **Better Typography:** Clear hierarchy with proper font sizes and weights
- **Improved Empty States:** Friendly messages when no requests exist

#### Visual Improvements:
- Modern card-based design
- Consistent color scheme (blue primary, green success, red danger, orange warning)
- Better button styling with hover effects
- Responsive grid layout
- Smooth transitions and animations

### 2. ScheduleViewer Component - Cancel Functionality ✅
**File:** `components/ScheduleViewer.tsx`

**Problem:** Admins had no way to cancel confirmed classroom reservations.

**Solution:** Added cancel button functionality with confirmation dialogs:

#### Features Added:

##### Day View:
- **Cancel Button:** Red X button appears on the right side of each schedule card
- **Confirmation Dialog:** Prevents accidental cancellations
  - Clear warning message
  - "Keep Booking" button to abort
  - "Cancel Booking" button in red to confirm
- **Visual Feedback:** 
  - Red color scheme for destructive action
  - Hover effects on button
  - Ghost variant for minimal design

##### Week View:
- **Hover-to-Show Cancel Button:** Cancel button appears when hovering over schedule cards
- **Compact Design:** Small X button (3x3) in top-right corner
- **Same Confirmation Dialog:** Consistent UX across both views
- **Smooth Transitions:** Opacity animation for button appearance

#### Technical Implementation:
- Added `onCancelSchedule` prop to ScheduleViewer
- Prop drilling: App → AdminDashboard → ScheduleViewer → DayView/WeekView
- Optional prop with proper TypeScript typing
- AlertDialog component for confirmation
- Consistent with FacultySchedule cancel functionality

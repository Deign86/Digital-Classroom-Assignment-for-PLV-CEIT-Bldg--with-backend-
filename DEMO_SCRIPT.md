echo "📋 Prerequisites:"
echo "✓ Firebase project configured"
echo "✓ Environment variables set (.env file)"
echo "✓ Node.js and npm installed"
echo "✓ Development server running"
echo ""

echo "🔧 Setup Instructions:"
echo "1. Make sure you're on the 'feature/real-time-updates' branch"
echo "   git checkout feature/real-time-updates"

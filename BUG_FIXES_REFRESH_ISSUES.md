# Bug Fixes: Refresh Issues

## Date: October 3, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Classrooms Not Loading on Refresh
**Problem:** When refreshing the page, the database classrooms would sometimes not load, requiring users to log out and log back in to see the classrooms.

**Root Cause:** 
- The `getCurrentUser()` function was returning the cached user immediately without waiting for Firebase Auth to properly initialize
- The `loadAllData()` function was only called during the initial mount effect, not when the auth state changed
- If the auth state listener fired after the initialization effect, the data wouldn't reload

**Solution:**
1. **In `firebaseService.ts`:**
   - Added `authStateReadyPromise` that resolves when Firebase Auth state is first checked
   - Modified `ensureAuthStateListener()` to create and resolve this promise
   - Updated `getCurrentUser()` to wait for `authStateReadyPromise` before checking the user
   
2. **In `App.tsx`:**
   - Modified the auth state change listener to call `loadAllData()` when a new user is detected
   - This ensures data is loaded both on initial mount AND when auth state changes

**Changes:**
```typescript
// firebaseService.ts
let authStateReadyPromise: Promise<void> | null = null;
let authStateReadyResolve: (() => void) | null = null;

// Wait for auth state to be initialized in getCurrentUser()
if (authStateReadyPromise) {
  await authStateReadyPromise;
}

// App.tsx - Auth state listener now loads data when new user detected
if (user && !prevUser) {
  console.log('ðŸ“Š New user detected, loading data...');
  loadAllData().catch(err => {
    console.error('Failed to load data after auth change:', err);
  });
}
```

### 2. Login/Signup Page Flashing on Refresh
**Problem:** When refreshing the page while logged in, there was a brief flash of the login/signup page before the user's dashboard appeared.

**Root Cause:**
- The condition `if (isLoading || !isAuthChecked)` for the loading spinner allowed a brief moment where both were false before the user was set
- This caused React to render the login page component for a split second

**Solution:**
- Changed the loading condition from `if (isLoading || !isAuthChecked)` to `if (!isAuthChecked || isLoading)`
- Added clearer comment explaining that this prevents the flash of the login page while checking auth state
- The loading spinner now shows until BOTH auth has been checked AND loading is complete

**Changes:**
```typescript
// App.tsx
// Show loading state during initialization - only show this if auth hasn't been checked yet
// This prevents the flash of login page while checking auth state
if (!isAuthChecked || isLoading) {
  return <LoadingSpinner />;
}

// Only show login page after auth has been checked and confirmed there's no user
if (!currentUser) {
  return <LoginForm />;
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Classroom Loading Test:**
   - Log in as admin or faculty
   - Refresh the page multiple times (F5 or Ctrl+R)
   - Verify that classrooms appear immediately without needing to log out/in
   - Check browser console for loading messages

2. **Flash Prevention Test:**
   - Log in and wait for dashboard to fully load
   - Refresh the page
   - Observe the loading screen â†’ should go directly from loading to dashboard
   - Should NOT see any flash of the login/signup page

3. **Auth State Test:**
   - Open browser DevTools â†’ Application â†’ Storage â†’ Clear Site Data
   - Refresh the page â†’ should show login page (no auth state)
   - Log in â†’ should load dashboard with data
   - Refresh again â†’ should stay on dashboard with all data loaded

## Technical Details

### Auth State Flow
```
1. App initializes
2. isAuthChecked = false, isLoading = true â†’ Shows loading spinner
3. getCurrentUser() called â†’ waits for authStateReadyPromise
4. Firebase Auth state listener fires â†’ resolves authStateReadyPromise
5. If user exists â†’ setCurrentUser(user) â†’ loadAllData()
6. isAuthChecked = true, isLoading = false â†’ Shows dashboard
7. If no user â†’ Shows login page
```

### Data Loading Flow
```
Initial Load:
- initializeApp() â†’ getCurrentUser() â†’ loadAllData()

Auth State Change:
- onAuthStateChange fires â†’ new user detected â†’ loadAllData()

This ensures data loads in both scenarios:
- Cold start (browser refresh)
- Auth state change (login, token refresh)
```

## Files Modified
1. `lib/firebaseService.ts` - Auth state initialization logic
2. `App.tsx` - Loading state management and auth state listener

## Notes
- The fixes maintain backward compatibility with existing code
- No breaking changes to the API or user interface
- Console logging has been preserved for debugging
- All error handling remains intact
